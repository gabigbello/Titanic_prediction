This project is for data prediction based on the tragedy of Titanic. This is a competition released by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). 

1. Problem and goals description: 

"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” 
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)."

2. Softwares and languages used:

   - Python
   - VS Code

3. Steps of the solution:

   - Importing libraries on VS Code for Python
   - Reading the train.csv file, treating the data and cleaning it
   - Reading the test.csv file, treating the data and cleaning it
   - Creating our train set to train our models
   - Using different predict methods to predict the 'Survived' column on the test dataset
   - Checking to see which method is the most efficient
   - After the prediction of the 'Survived' column, saving our file with the columns 'PassengerId' and 'Survived'
